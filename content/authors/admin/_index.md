    summary: |
      My PhD dissertation focused on speech separation, a task that isolates a target speech from background noise (speech enhancement) or other interfering speakers (speaker separation). Speech processing is inherently a sequential task, making it a natural fit for neuromorphic computing, which excels in processing sequential data efficiently. While the human auditory system excels at speech separation, replicating this ability in artificial systems has proven challenging. Enhancing speech quality and intelligibility is a primary goal in speech separation tasks. To achieve this, I proposed integrating human speech elements into waveform-based deep neural networks (DNNs). This approach has proven to be a simple yet effective strategy for improving speech performance. My dissertation introduces three key solutions to effectively incorporate these human speech elements into waveform speech separation models. At the end of my PhD, our lab initiated an SNN project, and attending lectures on the topic sparked my interest in neuromorphic computing, motivating me to pursue related postdoctoral research.

  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

As a neuromorphic researcher, my work primarily focuses on developing <strong>neuromorphic algorithms</strong>, particularly <strong>spiking neural networks (SNNs)</strong>, with a special emphasis on <strong>uncertainty estimation</strong> and <strong>speech enhancement</strong>. <strong>Uncertainty estimation</strong> is a key tool for assessing the reliability of machine learning models, enabling robust decision-making in dynamic and noisy environments. It is vital for high-stakes applications such as self-driving vehicles, medical image processing, and financial forecasting. I have extensive research experience on <strong>speech separation</strong>, a task that isolates a target speech from background noise (<strong>speech enhancement</strong>) or other interfering speakers (<strong>speaker separation</strong>).
