As a neuromorphic researcher, my work primarily focuses on developing <strong>neuromorphic algorithms</strong>, particularly <strong>spiking neural networks (SNNs)</strong>, with a special emphasis on <strong>uncertainty estimation</strong> and <strong>speech enhancement</strong>. <strong>Uncertainty estimation</strong> is a key tool for assessing the reliability of machine learning models, enabling robust decision-making in dynamic and noisy environments. It is vital for high-stakes applications such as self-driving vehicles, medical image processing, and financial forecasting. I have extensive research experience on <strong>speech separation</strong>, a task that isolates a target speech from background noise (<strong>speech enhancement</strong>) or other interfering speakers (<strong>speaker separation</strong>).
